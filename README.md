# Bird_species_Classification

Model built using Machine Learning algorithms to classify the species of birds on AVONET database.
Datasets are taken and preprocessing step such as EDA, data cleaning are performed.

## Dataset Description:
  The AVONET database contains comprehensive functional trait data for all birds, including six ecological variables, eleven continuous morphological traits, and information on range size and location.
 
## Preprocessing:
  Preprocessing such as removing the null values, encoding, and scaling the values to comman range are performed.
  Feature extraction is performed, selecting only the required features in the dataset, remoing the irrelevant ones for building the model.
